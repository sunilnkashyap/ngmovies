Implement a "movie store" (like blockbusters or Netflix). The store needs to hold a number of movies (letâ€™s say 10 or 15 is sufficient for our testing purposes). The following design concept deals as example for the basic layout of your moviestore:

The requirements

We need to see the most popular movies on the start screen.
We need to be able to search the movie store by their titles.
We need a watchlist implementation to store movies you'd like to see later. This list should be accessible in a separate view. It is not necessary but desirable that the watchlist is stored locally and is still available after refreshing the page.
